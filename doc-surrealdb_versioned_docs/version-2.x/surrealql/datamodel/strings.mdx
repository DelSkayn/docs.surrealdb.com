# Strings

Strings can be used to store text values. All text fields can include unicode values, emojis, and tabular and multine breaks.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet';
```

Strings can be created using single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet";
```

Any string in SurrealDB can include unicode text.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = "I ❤️ SurrealDB";
```

Strings can also include line breaks.

```surql
CREATE person SET text = "This
is
over
multiple
lines";
```

## String prefixes <l className='purple'>Since 1.1.0</l>

In SurrealQL, there are several types of string like, quouted values each with a different prefix indicating it's type.
Previously in the 1.0 SurrealQL would eagerly convert strings to a different type depending on it's contents. 
However with the 2.0 strings no longer eagerly convert, instead if you want a string like value to be a type other then string you must prefix it with the correct prefix.

### Overview

Here are a couple of examples of how string prefixes work:

```surql
RETURN s"5:20";
RETURN r"person:tobie";
```

### `s` -> string {#string}

The most commonly used string prefix, `s` tells the parser that the contents of this string is just a string. 
The `s` prefix shows up in the database output to make it clear to the viewer as well that the output is a string.
This is, since 2.0, completely optional. 
All strings without a prefix will be plain strings.
So the following two queries are equivalent.

```surql
-- with an optional string prefix.
RETURN s"5:20";
```

is completely equ
```surql
-- without an optional string prefix
RETURN "5:20";
```

```bash title="Response"
s'5:20'
```

### `r` -> record {#record}

The `r` prefix tells the parser that the contents of this string is a record ID.

```surql
RETURN r"person:john";
```

Without the `r` prefix the type of the value will be a string.

```surql
type::is::string("person:john");
type::is::record("person:john");
type::is::record(r"person:john");

[true,false,true]
```


### `d` -> datetime {#datetime}

The `d` prefix tells the parser that the contents of this string is a DateTime.

```surql
RETURN d"2023-11-28T11:41:20.262Z";
```

### `u` -> UUID {#uuid}

The `u` prefix tells the parser that the contents of this string is a UUID.

```surql
RETURN u"8c54161f-d4fe-4a74-9409-ed1e137040c1";
```

### String prefixes vs. casting

String prefixes seem outwardly similar to casting, but differ in behaviour. A string prefix is an instruction to the parser to treat an input in a certain way, whereas a cast is an instruction to the database to convert one type into another.

As a result, incorrect input with a cast will generate an error:

```surql
// Change _ to - in both examples to fix the input
RETURN <uuid>"018f0e6a_9b95-7ecc-8a38-aea7bf3627dd";
RETURN <datetime>"2024_06-06T12:00:00Z";
```

```bash title="Response"
-------- Query 1 --------
"Expected a uuid but cannot convert '018f0e6a-9b95-7ecc-8a38-aea7bf3627d' into a uuid"

-------- Query 2 --------

"Expected a datetime but cannot convert '2024-06-06T12:00:00' into a datetime"
```

But the same input using a string prefix will not even parse until the input is valid.

```surql
// Will not parse in either case until _ is changed to -
RETURN u"018f0e6a_9b95-7ecc-8a38-aea7bf3627dd";
RETURN d"2024_06-06T12:00:00Z";
```

This also allows for immediate error messages on which part of the input is incorrect. As seen in the image below, the parser is able to inform the user that an underscore at column 18 is the issue.
